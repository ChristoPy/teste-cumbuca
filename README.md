Repo for Cumbuca test for Software Developer

## Features
- **Register:** A user can create their account by providing: **full name**, **email**, **password** and **taxId**.  
If another account with same **email** or **taxId** already exists, the API complains about it.

- **Authentication:** A user can login with their credentials and receives a token that can't be generated by external peers.  
**The token expires in 24 hours**.  
If the credentials are not right, the API complains about it.

- **Authorization:** All routes that are protected, need to include the token received in the `Authentication` phase.  
If the credentials are not right, the API complains about it.
